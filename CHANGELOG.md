# Changelog

## 0.1.0

Initial TclMesh reference-kernel release.

### Added

- versioned immutable manifest registry;
- schema-aware canonical manifest hashing;
- explicit hash-bound manifest activation;
- canonical action runtime;
- transaction-guarded state transitions;
- holder-bound language capability enforcement;
- attenuating language delegation;
- fivefold deontic verdict resolution;
- explicit deontic execution blocking;
- idempotent effect ledger and effect-driver boundary;
- private-computation circuit IR validation;
- macro registry primitives;
- executable quickstart and end-to-end acceptance test;
- truthful test-process exit status.

### Security boundaries

- authoritative manifests reject mutable Tcl action callbacks;
- parent language lineage can only be created through delegation;
- state mutation and external effects remain separate;
- private circuit support in this release is IR-only and does not claim encrypted execution.
